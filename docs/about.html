        <h2 >About this Project</h2>
        <p>This webpage has been created in order to have stored everything that I have done in the Mobile Devices class during the fifth 
            semester of the Video Game Design & Development degree taught by CITM,UPC university in Terrassa. So when I do the final exam, 
            I'll be able to find anything I want searching it on the main page search box. All the code related to Flutter is created by my 
            teacher <a href="https://github.com/pauek">Pau Fernández</a>. </p>
        <h2 class= "h1">About me</h2>
        <p>As for me, I'm a passionate student of the degree mentioned above currently on the 3rd out of 4 year. My name 
            is <a href="https://github.com/youis11">Lluís Moreu </a> and last year I made a  <a href="https://github.com/youis11/Website-research">Website Research</a>
            and I found it so breathtaking that I wanted to do another website with some new widgets like a search box and code snippets. Also, Flutter(Dart) has some similarities with html and css with some parameters that I've 
            fallen in love with it &heartsuit; </p>
